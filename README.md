This is a support library for the [Weave](https://github.com/mratsim/weave) multithreading runtime.
Requirements for a multithreading runtime makes Synthesis also an excellent fit
to generate state machines for embedded devices, protocols
and managing complex event-driven workloads in general.

This package exports a set of macros to synthesize static procedure-based automata from
a declarative description of states, triggers and transitions
with all states, triggers and transitions known at compile-time.

It is fast, composable, generates compact code and does not allocate on the heap.

Within each states you also have the full power
of the Nim language instead of being restricted to only operations
supported by a custom domain-specific language.

The generated state machine is a procedure, with parameters of your choosing that access in your states.
You can easily call other procedures to build nested state machines or
introduce a stack of past states to create a pushdown automata (for parsing Brainfuck or JSON for example).

A detailed usage tutorial is available at [examples/water_phase_transitions.nim](). It is executable.

Snippets:
```Nim
type Phase = enum
  ## States of your automaton.
  ## The terminal state does not need to be defined
  Solid
  Liquid
  Gas
  Plasma # Plasma is almost unused

type Event = enum
  ## Named events. They will be associated with a boolean expression.
  Over100
  Between0and100
  Below0
  OutOfWater

# Common configuration
# -------------------------------------------

# Create a "waterMachine" entry.
declareAutomaton(waterMachine, Phase, Event)

# Optionally setup the "prologue". Extra state goes there, the variables are visible by all.
setPrologue(waterMachine):
  echo "Welcome to the Steamy machine version 2000!\n"
  var temp: float64

# Mandatory initial state. This must be one of the valid state of the state enum ("Phase" in our case)
setInitialState(waterMachine, Liquid)

# Terminal state is mandatory. It's a pseudo state and does not have to be part of the state enum.
setTerminalState(waterMachine, Exit)

# Optionally setup the "epilogue". Cleaning up what was setup in the prologue goes there.
setEpilogue(waterMachine):
  echo "Now I need some coffee."

# Events
# -------------------------------------------

implEvent(waterMachine, OutOfWater):
  tempFeed.len == 0

implEvent(waterMachine, Between0and100):
  0 < temp and temp < 100

implEvent(waterMachine, Below0):
  temp < 0

implEvent(waterMachine, Over100):
  100 < temp

# `onEntry` and `onExit` hooks
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Those are applied on each state entry, before conditions are checked
# and on each state exits. The only exceptions are "interrupt" behaviours.

onEntry(waterMachine, [Solid, Liquid, Gas]):
  let oldTemp = temp
  temp = tempFeed.pop()
  echo "Temperature: ", temp

# `behaviors`
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Interrupts are special triggers which ignores onEntry/onExit
#
# They allow the normal operations to make assumptions like
# a container not being empty or a value being available.
#
# They are also suitable to handle termination signals.

behavior(waterMachine):
  ini: [Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma]
  fin: Exit
  interrupt: OutOfWater
  transition:
    echo "Running out of steam ..."

# Conditional state change, depending on temperature.
behavior(waterMachine):
  ini: Solid
  fin: Liquid
  event: Between0and100
  transition:
    assert 0 <= temp and temp <= 100
    echo "Ice is melting into Water.\n"

behavior(waterMachine):
  ini: Liquid
  fin: Gas
  event: Over100
  transition:
    assert temp >= 100
    echo "Water is vaporizing into Vapor.\n"

#...

# Steady state, if no phase change was triggered, we stay in our current phase
behavior(waterMachine):
  steady: [Solid, Liquid, Gas]
  transition:
    # Note how we use the oldTemp that was declared in `onEntry`
    echo "Changing temperature from ", oldTemp, " to ", temp, " didn't change phase. How exciting!\n"

# `Synthesize`
# -------------------------------------------
# Synthesizing the automaton will transform the previous specification
# into a concrete procedure with a name, type and inputs of your choosing.
#
# Assertions are inserted to ensure the automaton
# stops if a state+event combination was not handled.
#
# You can pass "-d:debugSynthesis" to view the state machine generated
# at compile-time.
#
# The generated code can also be copy-pasted for debugging or for further refining.
synthesize(waterMachine):
  proc observeWater(tempFeed: var seq[float])

# Running the machine
# -------------------------------------------
import random, sequtils

echo "\n"
# Create 20 random temperature obeservations.
var obs = newSeqWith(20, rand(-50.0..150.0))
echo obs
echo "\n"
observeWater(obs)

# Output

## Technical constraints

The state machine is used as the core of a multithreading runtime:
- Threading friendly:
  - No GC or memory management on the heap

- Easy to map to model checking and formal verification via clearly labeled: states, events, transitions.

  Multithreading is complex and the more we can prove properties (like the absence of deadlocks or livelocks)
  the more confidence we can have in the runtime.

- Extremely fast and very low CPU-overhead, as overhead in the state machine means more latency in scheduling work. Furthermore, slowness effects are "scaled" by the number of cores.

- Extensibility: as runtime requirements grow (distributed clusters, heterogeneous computing, fine-grained barriers, IO, continuations, cancellations,...),

  Synthesis should help minimizing the potential for entangled control-flow
  and missing edge-cases.

Synthesis generates a procedure-based automaton using gotos for transitions:
  - This avoids function calls/returns pushing/poping stack overhead
  - and switch dispatch branch prediction miss due to having a single point of dispatch..

In addition to the multithreading runtime requirements this architecture
allow Synthesis to produce code with a very low footprint which makes it suitable for embedded.
Furthermore, setPrologue/setEpilogue/onEntry/onExit and the transitions are very flexible, they can
use inline statements, declare new variables or defer computation to one or more procs.
